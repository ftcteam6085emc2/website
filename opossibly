     <p><h4 class="text-monospace">2018-2019 season, 'bot, and challenge</h4>
     <p><h6 class="text-monospace">ROVER RUCKUS℠ presented by Qualcomm® Incorporated is played on a 12 ft. x 12 ft. (3.7m x 3.7m) square field with approximately 1 ft. (0.3 m) high walls and a soft foam mat floor. The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing alliance by descending from the Lander, collecting Minerals from the Crater, sorting and scoring Minerals into the Cargo Hold of the Lander, performing Autonomous tasks, and navigating to specific parts of the Playing Field. The Scoring Elements for the game are 60 Silver Minerals and 90 Gold Minerals, and a team supplied Team Marker.</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">There are two alliances of two robots each – “red” and “blue”. There are two alliance-neutral Craters sit in opposite corners of the Playing Field and two Alliancespecific Depots are in the other corners. Unique navigation targets are placed in the center of each field wall. In front of each corner is a Mineral Sampling Field with 2 Silver Minerals and 1 Gold Mineral, randomly lined up. Field personnel will randomize the Minerals in the Sampling Field prior to the start of the Match. The remaining Minerals are divided approximately equally and placed in each Crater.</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">The Lander sits in the center of the field with Alliancespecific Landing Zones marked by red and blue tape surrounding it. Prior to the start of a match, robots may be Latched onto the Lander. Robots that cannot be Latched must start in the alliance’s Landing Zone under one of the Alliance’s Lander Support Bracket. Robots may also preload a Team Marker.</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">Matches have two distinct periods of play: a 30-second autonomous period followed by a two-minute drivercontrolled period, the last 30 seconds of the drivercontrolled period is called the end game which adds new scoring opportunities for robots to achieve.</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace"><p class="font-weight-bold">Autonomous Period:</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">During the autonomous period, robots operate using only pre-programmed instructions and sensor inputs. Alliances earn points by: Landing – robots lower themselves from the Lander onto the Playing Field; Sampling – robots identify the single Gold Mineral in each Sample Field; Claiming – Robots place the Team Marker in their corresponding Depot; and Parking – robots that end the autonomous period in a Crater earn points.</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace"><p class="font-weight-bold">Driver-Controlled Period:</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">During the driver-controlled period, alliances earn points by placing Minerals into their alliance’s Cargo Holds and Depot. Gold Minerals must be placed in the Gold Cargo Hold and Silver Minerals into the Silver Cargo Hold to score. Any Mineral in the Depot increases the Alliances score.</p>
<h6 class="text-monospace"><p class="font-weight-bold">End Game:</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">The final 30 seconds of the driver-controlled period is called the end game. In addition to the driver-controlled period tasks, Alliances earn points by Latching onto the Lander or by Parking In or Completely in any Crater.</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">2018-2019 season robot fun facts! First off the robots name is Bertha. Her favorite color is Blood red. Bertha's dream vacation would be a sandy beach in Hawaii. She prefers pencils over pens (consumption of course). And Bertha was always prepared to destroy her opponents.</h6>

<p><h6 class="text-monospace">FIRST RELIC RECOVERYSM Presented by Qualcomm® Incorporated is played on a 12 ft. × 12 ft. (3.7m × 3.7m) square field with approximately 1 ft. (0.3m) high walls and a soft foam mat floor. The object of the game is to attain a higher score than the opposing alliance by 
<h6 class="text-monospace">(1) scoring Glyphs into the Cryptoboxes and completing rows, column, and ciphers</h6> 
<h6 class="text-monospace">(2) transferring Relics to the Recovery Zone</h6> 
<h6 class="text-monospace">(3) retrieving Jewels</h6> 
<h6 class="text-monospace">(4) parking on the Balancing Stones</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">(5) navigating to specific parts of the Playing Field.</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">The field is divided in the middle into a “red” and a “blue” side corresponding to the two alliances. In the center of the field is a taped off area that hold the Glyphs. The scoring elements for FIRST RELIC RECOVERYSM are 48 alliance-neutral Glyphs (24 gray and 24 brown), 8 alliance-specific Jewels (4 per alliance) and 4 alliance- specific Relics (2 per Alliance). There are 4 alliance- specific Cryptoboxes (2 per Alliance) with taped off safe zones in front of each. There are 4 alliance-specific Balancing Stones (2 per Alliance) on which Robots begin and end the game. There are also 2 off-field alliance- specific Recovery Zones where robots place recovered Relics at the end of the match.</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">Matches have two distinct periods of play: a 30-second Autonomous period followed by a two-minute Driver- Controlled period. The last 30 seconds of the Driver- Controlled period is called the End Game which adds new scoring opportunities for robots to achieve.<h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace"><p class="font-weight-bold">Autonomous Period:</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">During the Autonomous period, Robots operate using only pre-programmed instructions. Alliances earn points by:</h6> 
<h6 class="text-monospace">(1) selecting and removing opponent colored Jewels from platforms</h6> 
<h6 class="text-monospace">(2) scoring Glyphs into the Cryptoboxes</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">(3) parking their Robot in a Safe Zone in front of their Cryptobox.</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace"><p class="font-weight-bold">Driver-Controlled Period:</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">During the Driver-Controlled period, alliances earn points by: (1) Scoring Glyphs into their Alliance’s Cryptoboxes and (2) Creating Cipher patterns with their Glyphs in the Cryptoboxes.</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace"><p class="font-weight-bold">End Game:</h6>
<h6 class="text-monospace">The final 30 seconds of the Driver-Controlled Period is called the End Game. In addition to the previously listed Driver-Controlled Period scoring activities, alliances earn points by (1) moving their Relics to safety in their Recovery Zone and (2) balancing Robots on the Balancing Stones. The robot is under construction.</h6>
